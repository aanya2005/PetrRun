# PetrRun

25' Summer GitHub/UCI Hackathon

Welcome to **PetrRun**, a fast-paced, Zot-filled game built with UCI spirit during the 2025 Summer GitHub/UCI Hackathon!

> "It’s chaotic, it’s late-night, it’s UCI — and now, it’s a game."

## 🎮 What is PetrRun?

PetrRun is a rhythm-based browser game inspired by UCI’s legendary _Petr drops_ and _Zot culture_. Think piano tiles — but with anteater stickers, Zot symbols, and campus chaos. Hit the right Zot move at the right time to rack up points. Miss it? Zot outta luck.

## 🔧 Built With

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript animations
- [Optional] TensorFlow.js (for gesture recognition, if used)
- Ant-eater themed sticker art 🎨

## 🧠 Inspiration

We wanted to build something just for UCI students — something that captures the _fever dream energy_ of college nights, meme culture, and our undying love for campus inside jokes.

And of course… Zot Zot Zot 🐜💥

## 🔊 Features

- Smooth animations with moving Zot-stickers
- Background music that fades in for ~vibes~
- Score system based on timing accuracy
- Mobile-friendly (kinda chaotic in a fun way)
